MCA Insights Engine
A comprehensive platform for automated corporate data monitoring, analysis, and intelligence using MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) company master data.

 Project Overview
The MCA regularly publishes company master data as state-wise CSV files on data.gov.in. This project addresses key challenges in leveraging this data effectively:
Data Fragmentation: Unifies multiple state-wise files into a single coherent dataset
Dynamic Nature: Automatically tracks changes across data releases (new incorporations, removals, updates)
Lack of Context: Enriches data with supplementary information from public sources
Accessibility: Provides intuitive interfaces for non-technical users to query and visualize data

Project Objectives
Data Integration & Normalization: Merge multiple CSV files into a clean, standardized master dataset
Change Detection & Audit Logging: Systematically identify and log changes between data snapshots
Public Data Enrichment: Augment company data with information from sources like ZaubaCorp
Interactive Data Access: Web dashboard for searching, filtering, and visualizing data
AI-Powered Intelligence: Conversational AI chatbot for natural language data queries

Technology Stack
Backend: Python (Data Processing, ETL Pipeline)
Database: MySQL (Persistent Storage with Audit Trail)
Web Automation: Selenium (Data Enrichment with Anti-detection)
Frontend: Streamlit (Web Dashboard & Visualization)
AI/ML: Ollama with Llama 3.2 (Local Conversational AI)

Usage
Data Management: File upload, processing, and master data viewing
Advanced Analysis: Interactive visualizations and exploration
AI Chat Assistant: Natural language queries about company data
