### MCA Insights Engine
A comprehensive platform for automated corporate data monitoring, analysis, and intelligence using MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) company master data.

### Project Overview
1.The MCA regularly publishes company master data as state-wise CSV files on data.gov.in. This project addresses key challenges in leveraging this data effectively:
2.Data Fragmentation: Unifies multiple state-wise files into a single coherent dataset
3.Dynamic Nature: Automatically tracks changes across data releases (new incorporations, removals, updates)
4.Lack of Context: Enriches data with supplementary information from public sources
5.Accessibility: Provides intuitive interfaces for non-technical users to query and visualize data

### Project Objectives
1.Data Integration & Normalization: Merge multiple CSV files into a clean, standardized master dataset
2.Change Detection & Audit Logging: Systematically identify and log changes between data snapshots
3.Public Data Enrichment: Augment company data with information from sources like ZaubaCorp
4.Interactive Data Access: Web dashboard for searching, filtering, and visualizing data
5.AI-Powered Intelligence: Conversational AI chatbot for natural language data queries

### Technology Stack
1.Backend: Python (Data Processing, ETL Pipeline)
2.Database: MySQL (Persistent Storage with Audit Trail)
3.Web Automation: Selenium (Data Enrichment with Anti-detection)
4.Frontend: Streamlit (Web Dashboard & Visualization)
5.AI/ML: Ollama with Llama 3.2 (Local Conversational AI)

### Usage
1.Data Management: File upload, processing, and master data viewing
2.Advanced Analysis: Interactive visualizations and exploration
3.AI Chat Assistant: Natural language queries about company data
